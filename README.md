This app confirms whether you're actually looking at your phone screen, as sometimes we're just not sure.
Still looking for funding to increase the functionality. Google or Facebook, shoot me a mail.

To do list:
* Show notification when you're not looking at your phone
* Tweet each time you're not looking at the phone
* Let the phone vibrate if you're not looking at it
